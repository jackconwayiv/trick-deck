      <h3>The Starting Deck</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>60 card singleton</li>
        <li>A commander of any rarity</li>
        <li>
          ~35 common or uncommon creatures and spells (~19 creatures and ~16
          spells recommended; consider ramp, draw, removal, protection, and
          offense)
        </li>
        <li>
          ~24 basic, common, or uncommon lands (~12 basic and ~12 nonbasic
          recommended)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deck Progression</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When building a deck, create a binder or "prizeboard" of cards you
          will add as you win scenarios in a campaign. You will ultimately be
          able to add or swap in a maximum of 14 higher rarity lands, 12 mythic
          rares, and 36 rares on your journey from 60 to 100 cards, through 45
          deck levels (4 full campaigns).
        </li>
        <li>
          16 of the 36 rares and 6 of the 12 mythic rares are card swaps and
          could optionally be spent to swap out lower rarity lands. (Note: you
          will add 14 higher rarity lands, according to the deck level chart, as
          your deck grows from 60 to 100 cards.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deck Star Rank ★☆☆☆☆</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A general metric of the strength of your deck is its star rank. A deck
          can rank from 1 to 5 stars.
        </li>
        <li>
          +1 star if your deck includes cards with no expansion symbol, or cards
          with expansion symbols other than from three sets that were printed
          into Standard. (For example, Commander deck cards were not printed
          into Standard.)
        </li>
        <li>+1 star if your deck includes 15 or more rares or mythic rares.</li>
        <li>+1 star if your deck includes 30 or more rares or mythic rares.</li>
        <li>+1 star if your deck includes 45 or more rares or mythic rares.</li>
        <li>Print & Play - Deck Tracking Cards</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Deck Level Chart</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your deck starts at level 1. After each successfully completed
          scenario, your deck gains a level and adds or swaps in at least one
          card, and maybe increases in star rank, according to this scheme:
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
